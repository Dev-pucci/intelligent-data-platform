# nginx Configuration Files

This directory contains nginx configuration files for deploying the Intelligent Data Acquisition Platform.

## Quick Answer to Your Question

**Q: Can nginx replace VPS deployment?**

**A: No** - nginx is web server software, not a server itself.

- **nginx** = Software (like a traffic cop)
- **VPS** = Server/Computer (the road)

You need BOTH for production deployment, OR you can use nginx locally on your computer for development.

## What's Included

- `nginx.conf` - Main nginx configuration
- `nginx-ssl.conf` - HTTPS configuration with SSL
- `nginx-production.conf` - Production VPS configuration

## Deployment Options

See [DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md](../DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md) for complete comparison.

### Option 1: No nginx (Current)
- Access: `http://localhost:5678`
- Good for: Basic development

### Option 2: Local nginx (Recommended)
- Access: `http://scraper.local`
- Good for: Professional development
- Cost: Free

### Option 3: VPS + nginx (Production)
- Access: `https://scraper.yourdomain.com`
- Good for: Production/Team use
- Cost: ~$5-20/month

## Quick Setup (Local nginx on Windows)

1. Install nginx: `choco install nginx`
2. Copy `nginx.conf` to `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf`
3. Edit hosts file: Add `127.0.0.1 scraper.local`
4. Start nginx: `cd C:\nginx && start nginx`
5. Access: `http://scraper.local`

Done! âœ“
