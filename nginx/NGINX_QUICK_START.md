## Manual Setup (If Script Fails)

### Step 1: Install nginx

**Option A: Chocolatey (Recommended)**
```batch
choco install nginx
```

**Option B: Manual Download**
1. Go to: http://nginx.org/en/download.html
2. Download: nginx/Windows (stable)
3. Extract to: `C:\nginx`

### Step 2: Copy Configuration

Copy `nginx/nginx.conf` to `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf`

### Step 3: Update Hosts File

Edit: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

Add these lines:
```
127.0.0.1   scraper.local
127.0.0.1   api.scraper.local
127.0.0.1   grafana.scraper.local
```

**Note**: Requires Administrator privileges

### Step 4: Test Configuration

```batch
cd C:\nginx
nginx -t
```

Should show: "test is successful"

### Step 5: Start nginx

```batch
cd C:\nginx
start nginx
```

### Step 6: Verify

```batch
curl http://scraper.local/health
```

Should return: "n8n proxy healthy"

## nginx Management

### Start nginx
```batch
cd C:\nginx
start nginx
```

### Stop nginx
```batch
cd C:\nginx
nginx -s stop
```

### Reload Configuration
```batch

## Accessing Services

With nginx running:

| Service | Old URL | New URL |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **n8n** | http://localhost:5678 | http://scraper.local |
| **API** (future) | http://localhost:8000 | http://api.scraper.local |
| **Grafana** (future) | http://localhost:3000 | http://grafana.scraper.local |

## Troubleshooting

### nginx won't start

**Error**: "bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed"

**Solution**: Another service is using port 80
```batch
# Find what's using port 80
netstat -ano | findstr :80

# Stop IIS if running
iisreset /stop
```

### Can't access scraper.local

**Check 1**: Is nginx running?
```batch
tasklist /fi "imagename eq nginx.exe"
```

**Check 2**: Is hosts file updated?
```batch
type C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts | findstr scraper
```

**Check 3**: Is n8n running?
```batch
curl http://localhost:5678
```

### Page shows 502 Bad Gateway

**Cause**: n8n is not running

**Solution**: Start n8n
```batch
cd C:\Users\PUCCI\Desktop\gem\intelligent-data-platform
npx n8n start
```

## Benefits of This Setup

### For Development
‚úì Professional URLs
‚úì Practice production setup
‚úì Easy to remember addresses
‚úì Prepare for VPS deployment

### For Future Production
‚úì Same nginx config works on VPS
‚úì Easy migration path
‚úì Already understand the setup
‚úì Just add domain and SSL

## Next Steps

### Now (With Local nginx)
1. Access n8n at `http://scraper.local`
2. Import workflows
3. Configure PostgreSQL
4. Build automation

### Later (Production Deployment)
1. Rent VPS ($5-20/month)
2. Point domain to VPS
3. Copy nginx config to VPS
4. Add SSL certificate (free)
5. Access from anywhere!

See [DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md](../DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md) for VPS guide.
