## 4. Chapter 1: Introduction
-   **1.1 Problem Statement:** Discuss the challenges of web scraping, data acquisition from diverse sources, and the need for intelligent, automated solutions.
-   **1.2 Project Goals and Objectives:** Clearly state what the platform aims to achieve (e.g., 100+ sites, AI parsing, monitoring, orchestration).
-   **1.3 Scope of the Project:** Define what is included and excluded from the project.
-   **1.4 Report Structure:** Briefly describe the organization of the report.

## 5. Chapter 2: Background and Related Work
-   **2.1 Web Scraping Techniques:** Overview of static HTML, SPA, API, PDF, and Excel scraping methods.
-   **2.2 AI in Data Extraction:** Discuss the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) and local inference (Ollama, DeepSeek) in parsing complex/unstructured data.
-   **2.3 Workflow Orchestration:** Explain the benefits and use of tools like n8n.
-   **2.4 Monitoring and Alerting:** Introduce Prometheus and Grafana for system observability.

## 6. Chapter 3: System Architecture and Design
-   **3.1 High-Level Architecture:** Present a block diagram illustrating the main components and their interactions.
-   **3.2 Detailed Component Design:** Describe each architectural layer:
    -   **Discovery Layer (Crawler):** `CrawlerEngine`, `URLFilter`.
    -   **Extraction Layer (Scrapers):** `BaseScraper`, `UniversalScraper`, `HTMLScraper`, `SPAScraper` (and planned API, PDF, Excel scrapers).
    -   **Parsing Layer:** `ParserManager`, `CSSParser`, `XPathParser`, `AIParser` (and planned JSONParser).
    -   **Transformation Layer:** `DataTransformer`.
    -   **Validation Layer:** `DataValidator`.
    -   **Storage Layer:** PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLAlchemy ORM.
    -   **API Layer:** FastAPI, Pydantic models.
    -   **Monitoring Layer:** Prometheus, Grafana, Exporters.
    -   **Orchestration Layer:** n8n workflows.
-   **3.3 Data Flow Diagram:** Illustrate how data moves through the pipeline (Crawler -> Scraper -> Parser -> Transformer -> Validator -> Storage).
-   **3.4 Database Schema Design:** Explain the `scraped_data`, `crawl_state`, `sites`, `scrape_jobs`, `data_quality_issues` tables and their relationships.
-   **3.5 Design Principles:** Discuss adherence to config-driven, template-based, separation of concerns, and intelligent fallbacks.

## 7. Chapter 4: Implementation Details
-   **4.1 Technology Stack Justification:** Explain why specific technologies were chosen.
-   **4.2 Key Module Implementations:** Detail the implementation of core modules (e.g., `CrawlerEngine`'s BFS/DFS, `UniversalScraper`'s routing, `ParserManager`'s delegation).
-   **4.3 AI Integration:** Describe the Ollama + DeepSeek integration for AI parsing.
-   **4.4 Database Integration:** Explain SQLAlchemy ORM usage, batch inserts, and change detection logic.
-   **4.5 Workflow Automation:** Detail the n8n workflows for scheduled scraping, error handling, and data quality.
-   **4.6 Monitoring Setup:** Describe Prometheus configuration, Grafana dashboards, and alert rules.

## 8. Chapter 5: Testing and Evaluation
